linux
---------------------------


1) How many types of linux file permissions are there? please provide the number that denotes the permissions as well?

         Read(4): Users open and read files with this permission.
         Write(2): Users can open and modify the files.
         Execute(1): Users can run the file.

       rwx - 421, given to user, group and others

    using command   $chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,O=r myfile.txt  and   $chmod 777 myfile.txt

     to change owner ::  $sudo chown myuser myfile.txt



2) what are hard links and soft links in Linux?Would you be able to access the file if you delete a softlink?

 
> Hard link: hard link is the  copyof a file content for which we create hardlink.

             if we delete the original file still you will have the content in hard link
             
             we can create hard links with in a directories.
           
             (hard links and original file will have same i node values so the hard link represent the same original file location.
              
             hard link also one type of pointer to a file.)

 > softlink: soft link is shortcut to file or directory. 

            Soft Link contains the path of original file and not the content. 

            if we delete the original file then softlink become inactive .
  
            (inode values of softlink and original files are different.


>  creating hard link :  ln <filename/path> <hardlinkname>
>  creating soft link :  ln -s <filename/path> <softlinkname>
> to see link         : ln -li


4) Which user in Linux has super user permissions by default?

Root user has SUDO permission by deafult

5) what are zombie or defunct process or dead processes? what system resource(s) they use?

A process that has completed its execution but still has an entry in the process table. 

      (which is waiting for it's parent to read the status code.Until the parent process reads the status code of the child process,
          the PID of the child process will be in process table.)

> to find jombie process : $top, $htop------- it shows status or S :: in output:
 
  
             D = uninterruptible sleep , I = idle, R = running, S = sleeping, T = stopped by job control signal, 
             t = stopped by debugger during trace, Z = zombie
             
> kill-9 <process_id> -- for zombie process ::(     it consumes memory   )
> kill-9 <Parent process_id> -- for zombie process ::(   it consumes memory    )



6) What are daemons?

 > Daemons process also called as background process, these are the long running program of linux which executes in the baground,
 they dont have terminal so exicute inthe baground

 > these process starts when computer is bootsrapped and terminated only when system shutdowns.

   > line printing deamons is a demon that can control the print spooling process.

(Daemons are services that provide several functions that may not be available under the base operating system.
 Its main task is to listen for service request and at the same time to act on these requests. 
After the service is done, it is then disconnected and waits for further requests.)


7) How do you terminate an ongoing process?

-kill <process_id>
-kill-9 <process_id> -- for jombie process

          for pid :   $ps ,  $ps a , $top, $ htop, $sar, $$ - for cureent process id
 
           Prints the PID :: $echo "$$"

           Prints the PPID:: echo "${PPID}"

   ps aux | grep {process-name-here} ;;;; nginex, mysqlid,,,etc. ex: $ps aux | grep -E 'nginx|mysql|apache'
   
   ps -aux | grep {process-to-find-here}


9) what are the different commands to see CPU utilization inLinux system
Any two of the following should be fine:

-/cat/porc/cpuinfo
-lscpu
- top
- htop
- sar
- iostat

for memory :
--/cat/porc/cpuinfo
-- $ free
--$vmstat (Virtual Memory Statistics)
-- top
-- htop


8) what is the basic command to check the disk utilization
-df -h
-du -h
-lsblk

                                                                    AWS
                                                     -----------------------------------------------------------

1) what are the networking services offerings from AWS? (3-4 responses should be fine)

AWS VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)
AWS Virtual Private Network                     Amazon EC2     Load Balancers  Amazon Gateway  AWS PrivateLink    Amazon VPC Flow Logs   VPC Traffic Mirroring

Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

Amazon Route 53

Amazon CloudFront

AWS Transit Gateway
AWS PrivateLink

AWS Direct Connect



2. What is the relation between the Availability Zone and Region?

  AWS Regions are separate geographic areas. 

  AWS Regions consist of multiple Availability Zones they may be  physically separated and isolated  .

  (that are connected with low latency, high throughput, highly redundant networking.)

ex: like the US-West 1 (North California) and Asia South (Mumbai).

 

3. what are the steps involved in changing the instance states (type )of an EC2 instance

       You can change the state of an instance from the AWS management console  - (goto aws--search ec2-- see isntances)

select the instance -->goto isntance action-- we can see start, stop, reboot,terminate. options


     - start  :  Here, you can stop the running state.

     - Stop  :  Here, you can stop the running state.

      -Reboot : This is used to reboot an instance

     -Terminate :- This state is used to terminate an instance permanently.


4. What is the monitoring service that AWS offers?

  1. monitoring service : Cloudwatch  :  (AWS) offers a monitoring service called Amazon CloudWatch. 

    

       CloudWatch can be used to monitor AWS resources and applications in real time. It can also be used to monitor KPIs from within AWS EC2 instances.

         Collect and visualize metrics across services
         Create customized dashboards
         Set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold
         Respond to performance changes
         Optimize resource use
         Provide insights into operational health    

 2.monitoring tools :
     Nagios XI
     Dynatrace
     EG Innovations' monitoring service



5. Can we access S3 bucket which was created in one region from another?

- Yes, S3 is a global resource. An S3 bucket once created in a particular region, can be accessed from different regions but the latency will be different.
  
  latency : delay in comminication or data transfer.



6. How do you access AWS VPC logs?

aws VPC Flow Logs is a feature that enables you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC

- Cloundwatch and cloudwatch logs

- VPC flow logs


(goto aws console -- search vpc service -- goto vpc dashbord -- select the instance -- goto flow logs.

 to access aws vpc logs -- first Setup VPC Flow Logs swtup to save   in s3 buket  or  To CloudWatch Log Group. 

from s3 buket we can acces logs )





-------------------------------------k8s --------------------

    kubernetes
                                                  ---------------------

1. What is a deployment vs pod?

   > Deployment :  A deployment is an management tool in Kubernetes that lets us  to manage a set of identical pods
     
        / Ensures that pods have the correct configuration and that the right number of them exist
  
  
 > Pod :         A pod is the smallest deployment unit in Kubernetes  / house one or more containers . 
   
            A pod is the smallest deployment unit in Kubernetes that  -  usually represents one instance/ applications of the containerized application


2. How can you ensure a deployment runs 5 pods?

   > Deployment is created by using YAML file , there we need togive repilca value as  5

     > to do changes in yamel file  --use : vim particular yaml file  ---- vim deploy.yaml(its a file)

     > to create or edit previous pod :: kubectl apply -f pod.yaml   (or)  kubectl create -f pod.yaml
     
     > can create service, deployment,pods etc..

note :REPICA or  Replication is the process of making multiple copies of data and 

        storing them at different locations for backup purposes, 

        fault tolerance, and to improve their overall accessibility across a network. 



3.  what is the Command to list pods in a k8s cluster

   > kubectl get pods

   > kubectl get pods - O wide   gives more details

   > kubectl delete podname   ;; we get podname from kubectl get pods
